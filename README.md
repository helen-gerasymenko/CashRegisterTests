# CashRegisterTests
## C# implementation of a Grocery Store Cash Register.

Requirements:

1. Given a number of items you will be required to calculate the total bill.

2. Items are charged for in a couple of different ways:

   * A given price for each item, e.g. Boxes of Cheerios are $6.99 each.
   * A given price by weight, e.g. Apples are $2.49 per kg.
   * Items can go on sale where you might receive bulk discounts, e.g. Buy two get one free sales; Buy four get one free
   * Coupons are available to get money off the bill when the total amount is above a threshold, e.g. $5 off when you spend $100 or more.
 
3. The code should include a set of unit tests.
